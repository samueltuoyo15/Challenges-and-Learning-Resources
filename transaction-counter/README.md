# **Go Concurrent Transaction Counter**

A high-performance, thread-safe transaction counter service implemented in Go, designed to track real-time transaction volumes per currency. This project showcases robust concurrency patterns using Go's `sync` package for reliable data management in a multi-goroutine environment. üöÄ

## Overview

This Go project implements a `TransactionCounter` that efficiently manages and retrieves currency-specific transaction counts. It leverages `sync.RWMutex` to ensure all operations (incrementing, retrieving single counts, fetching all counts, and resetting) are thread-safe and performant under concurrent access from multiple goroutines.

## Features

*   **Concurrent Safety**: Utilizes `sync.RWMutex` for efficient read/write locking, ensuring data integrity and preventing race conditions across all operations.
*   **Increment Transaction Count**: Atomically increments the count for a specified currency.
*   **Retrieve Specific Count**: Fetches the current transaction count for any given currency.
*   **Retrieve All Counts**: Provides a consistent snapshot (copy) of all currency transaction counts as a map.
*   **Reset Counters**: Clears all accumulated transaction counts, reinitializing the service.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Installation

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

*   **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone your-repository-url-here
    cd interview-test
    ```

*   **Install Go**:
    Ensure you have Go installed on your system. This project was developed with Go version 1.24.3. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/).

*   **Run the Application**:
    Navigate to the project directory and execute the `main.go` file:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Usage

The `main.go` file contains a comprehensive test function that demonstrates the concurrent capabilities of the `TransactionCounter`. When you run `go run main.go`, it will:

*   Initialize a `TransactionCounter`.
*   Launch 100 goroutines that simulate concurrent transactions, each incrementing random currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY) 10 times.
*   Include occasional reads of specific currency counts within these goroutines.
*   Launch an additional goroutine to periodically read all currency counts.
*   Print the final counts after all concurrent operations complete.
*   Demonstrate the `Reset` functionality and print counts after reset.

**Example Output (will vary slightly due to concurrency):**

```
Goroutine 0: USD count is 1
Goroutine 0: EUR count is 1
Goroutine 1: USD count is 2
Goroutine 1: JPY count is 1
All counts: map[EUR:2 USD:3 GBP:1 JPY:1]
Goroutine 2: USD count is 4
...
Final counts: map[EUR:250 GBP:250 JPY:250 USD:250]
After reset: map[]
```

This output verifies the thread-safety and correctness of the counter operations under heavy concurrent load.
